Compiler for the Brown Decaf language. Note that the language appears to be modified frequently. This here is based on the specifications of a Stanford 2012 class. Some changes were made: (1) visibility of declarations and definitions is C/C++-like - from the point of declaration, (2) type coercion/conversion will be added (at least for basic type; unclear for classes), (3) we will short-circuit in the usual way, (4) debating if array/string/object assignment will be made 'shallow' (copy == copy of reference to representation). If we do, unclear if assigning to one copy should slice off its own copy, or overwrite all references to the same object. Execution goals include multiple parse rounds, probably refining first the AST, and then the generated original SSA-style IR; using a Visitor Pattern class to manage at least AST parsing; generating x86 32b assembly in backend once front end complete. Some of this will be done after HS - impossible (I believe) in time remaining.
