Compiler for the Brown Decaf language. Note that the language appears to be modified frequently. This here is based on the specifications of a Stanford 2012 class. Some changes were made: (1) visibility of declarations and definitions is C/C++-like - from the point of declaration (the compiler is one-pass), (2) type coercion/conversion will be added (at least for basic type; unclear for classes), (3) we will short-circuit in the usual way, (4) debating if array/string/object assignment will be made 'shallow' (copy == copy of reference to representation). If we do, unclear if assigning to one copy should slice off its own copy, or overwrite all references to the same object
